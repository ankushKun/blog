### Why NFTs?

What's the first thing you think when I tell you about NFTs? Some JPEG sold for a ton of ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°  with no real use?

Well no, NFTs can have much more use than just trading them for profits. They are a great way to verify ownership of a digital asset.

Lets assume you play PUBG, you buy skins and stuff in the game, you give them your money and they provide you with those skins. But do you really own these things which you paid for? Because these are centralised applications controlled by humans who can remove your purchases from your account and you probably wont be able to do anything, you dont own anything here.

Thats where NFTs can be useful, to buy an item in the game you could buy its corresponding NFT and you'll get that item in the game too, this time you really own one of the items in the game, on chain âœ¨

#### Wait but buying NFTs is expensive (and complicated) ðŸ˜¨

For the average internet user, buying NFTs or any digital assets like cryptocurrency can be a tough task.
As of now ETHereum is probably the most mainstream blockchain to mint and sell NFTs, but it also has very high gas fees (transaction fees).

So a better solution is <a href="https://deso.org" target="_blank">Decentralised Social</a> or DeSo for short.

Minting, selling and buying NFTs on deso is as easy as making an Instagran or Twitter post ðŸ˜Ž

With transaction fees so low, it's almost unexisting (as of March 2022)

Moreover, it offers a bunch of APIs using which you can build your own applications that use the DeSo blockchain in its own creative way.

### Stop talking and show me what you built

I built a simple example in Unity, where the user logs in using their DeSo account and the game lets them change skins if they own their NFTs on DeSo

Then minted 2 NFTs on DeSo with 100 copies each

Then wrote a bunch of code to make api calls to deso and check if the user owns those NFTs and finally enable/disable the skin for the user depending on their ownership status of thost NFTs.

## TL;DR

I setup shop system in unity where you can apply skins if you own their NFT, without having to create my own backend

Here's a video demonstrating it

This may be even used to reward users special items in the game, or grant access to hidden features and what not just by sending them an NFT :)

The applications are countless
